# Riive Shareparking App
This is a backup of Riive, a shareparking app currently in development. You can view my portfolio writeup about it here: https://www.christopherfrydryck.cf/Riive.html

This app is built on React Native and expo.  To test the app, first run `npm install` to ensure the node modules are up to date. Then run `expo r -c` to run the expo app as a local host and cleared cache.  You can create an account via on the sign up screen with fake info for now and it will update in the Firebase DB.

## To be completed:
+ Ability to add a location (In progress)
+ ~~Add edit payment screen~~
+ Add settings and promo screen
+ ~~Integrate tipsi-stripe for PCI compliance payment vendor~~
+ Begin google maps integration (In progress)

Of course there is more, but these are key milestones.
