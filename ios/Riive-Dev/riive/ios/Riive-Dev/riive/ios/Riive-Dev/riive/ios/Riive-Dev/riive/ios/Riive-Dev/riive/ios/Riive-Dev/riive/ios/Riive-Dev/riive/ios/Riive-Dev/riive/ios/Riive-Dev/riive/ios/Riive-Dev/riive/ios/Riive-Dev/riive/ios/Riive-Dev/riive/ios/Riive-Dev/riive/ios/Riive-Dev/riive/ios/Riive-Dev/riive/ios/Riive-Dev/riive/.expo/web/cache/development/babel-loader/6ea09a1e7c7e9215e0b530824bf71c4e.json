Space Reservation. Riive provides the Reservation Services to Users for the sole purposes of providing Users information on the location and apparent availability of parking and assisting them in securing parking at participating third-party parking locations, including but not limited to private driveways, private garages, public lots and private lots. In response to a User’s online request for a reservation through the Riive Site or a Riive Application, User communicates directly with the applicable individual holding/operating said space (the Host of the Listing) regarding such reservation request. The availability of reservations is determined at the time of a User’s query, and Riive makes no representation or warranty (i) regarding the accuracy of any data (including, but not limited to, reservation availability data) received from any Host. Each Host is an independent third party and is not under the control of Riive. Riive is not a guarantor, agent, or otherwise affiliated with any Host. You acknowledge that each Host may have its own policies, terms, and conditions. Once a reservation request is made by a User through the Riive Site or any Riive Application, the Host with such space will provide confirmation of the Reservation to such User by pre-authorizing the Services to auto accept all reservation requests within specified hours and specified days at the time of request. By using the Reservation Services, you agree to receive reservation confirmations by Riive messaging after requesting a Reservation through the Reservation Services. You may terminate your Registration at any time by emailing Riive at support@riive.net.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>In furtherance of (and not in any limitation of) the above, you hereby acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding the assistance that the Reservation Services provide to you in locating and reserving parking, the ultimate decision to utilize the parking information provided by the Reservation Services and to park at any location remains yours and yours alone, and you hereby agree to assume any risk inherent in utilizing the Reservation Services and/or deciding to actually park at any location. For the avoidance of doubt, Riive does not in any way provide parking services of any kind or operate any parking locations. FURTHER, RIIVE ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR 1) THE SAFETY OF ANY PERSON, PROPERTY, OR VEHICLE PARKED AT ANY LOCATION OR 2) THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF PARKING AT ANY LOCATION. USE OF, OR A RESERVATION THROUGH, ANY RIIVE APPLICATION WILL IN NO WAY BE CONSIDERED A WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATION THAT A SPECIFIC PARKING SPACE IS AVAILABLE AT ANY LOCATION AT ANY GIVEN TIME. RIIVE DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, DELAYS, OR OTHER CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY ARISE IF A PARKING SPACE IS UNAVAILABLE, OR IF A RIIVE APPLICATION OTHERWISE ERRS OR MALFUNCTIONS.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>2. Calculation of Parking Rates; Payment Authorization; Taxes. You acknowledge that Riive does not determine parking rates with Hosts to facilitate the booking of Reservations. Riive may make a suggestion to a host, but this is not bound to a host’s value of their space, nor should it reflect the decision of the value of a host’s parking space. The parking rate displayed on the Riive Site or Riive Application is determined solely by the Host and Riive’s fees are in direct relation to the price set by the Host. You agree to pay in full the price displayed on the Services for the total reservation price, which includes the parking rate plus, where applicable, service fees, and taxes at the time of your reservation request.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>All Reservations and other transactions consummated through the Riive Site or a Riive Application will be turned over to the relevant Host, and thereafter, a User may be required to enter into a separate agreement with that relevant Host. You acknowledge and confirm that you are authorized and permitted to use any credit card that you register on the Riive Site or a Riive Application. When you fund a transaction, you agree that Riive is not in any way responsible or liable for the transaction. You acknowledge that Riive may collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>3. Prices. The price of a parking reservation will be determined by the Host with the legal right to reserve said private location.

Severability. If any part of this Terms & Conditions is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and Agreement shall continue in effect</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>37. Assignment. This Terms & Conditions, and the rights granted and obligations undertaken hereunder, may not be transferred, assigned or delegated in any manner by a User, but may be freely transferred, assigned, or delegated by Riive.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>38. Waiver. Any waiver of any provision of this Terms & Conditions, or a delay by any party in the enforcement of any right hereunder, shall neither be construed as a continuing waiver nor create an expectation of non-enforcement of that or any other provision or right.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>39. Arbitration and Venue. Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause) between you and the Riive Parties or their successors or assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration in the state of Delaware in their Court of Chancery.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator, certified by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by this Terms & Conditions, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s  Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>You and Riive must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR RIIVE MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE ‘PARTY’S’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (d) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (e) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (f) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>Not withstanding the foregoing, either you or Riive may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in the state of Delaware. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Delaware in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Delaware for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) in this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Riive shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in Delaware.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>For more information on AAA, the Rules and Procedures, or the process for filing an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org. </Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>40. Choice of Law. The Services are operated by a U.S. entity, and this Terms & Conditions is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</Text>\n                <Text style={styles.para}>41.
